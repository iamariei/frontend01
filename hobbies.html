        <h2>Traveling</h2>
        <p>Be it just in an new neighbourhood or halfway across the globe, I love wandering around and discovering new sights and cultures. So far, I have been to about 20 countries around Europe, North America, and Asia.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite trips has been to Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, where I visited an university colleague. The city had amazing brand-new buildings, and the people were one of the friendliest I had ever met.</p>

        <p>Another memorable trip has been the one to Iceland. The nature looks out of this world, and the relaxed atmosphere of the small towns made me fall in love with the country so much that I actually decided to move here last year!</p>

        <p>In the future, I hope to visit Japan, Greenland, and the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten!

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>At the age of 12 I got my first camera, and ever since, I have been fascinated by the beautiful world of photography. I am especially interested in capturing landscapes and cityscapes.</p>
        <p>While I have owned better and better cameras over time, lately I have decided to use my phone for all photography both because I have it with me at all times and because I like the challenge of overcoming its limitations.</p>
